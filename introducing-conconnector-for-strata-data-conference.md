# Introducing ConConnector for Strata Data Conference

Strata Data San Jose is right around the corner and Memgraph is excited to be joining for the second time in a row. After a fantastic first experience in New York, we decided to come back for another chance to connect with brilliant people and companies. But this time around, we wanted to contribute to this vibrant community by building something that we believe will make things a little more interesting for all attendees.

Strata Data has come a long way and grew to attract thousands of attendees, speakers and companies. With so many things happening simultaneously, navigating the conference can get quite overwhelming, at least it did for us. We looked for ways to use the power of graph databases to connect the dots, map out relationships and visualize everything in simple to navigate interface.

### Introducing ConConnector

ConConnector is a free tool, purposely built to allow you to visualize and explore connections between attendees, speakers, companies, tweets, and view the Strata Data Conference from a totally new angle.

To get started, visit [www.Strata.Rocks](https://conconnector.memgraph.com/login) and login with your Twitter account. (Don’t worry, we don’t collect your information to spam you later on. In fact, we don’t ask for your email at all)

Once you’re logged-in, we use the information from your profile to recommend you 5 sessions that we think might be interesting to you. (We would love to know if those were relevant to you so please let us know on Twitter at [@memgraphdb](https://twitter.com/memgraphdb) :D)

You are now ready to explore our Conference Graph containing thousands of entities (nodes)and relationships (edges). Unfortunately, mobile devices are not suitable for an optimal visualization experience :(. This is why we invite you to choose one of the following options:

1. Visit the Conference Graph on your laptop computer.

1. Come visit us at our booth #P3 to explore the Conference Graph on a big TV Screen! This is by far the best option as we would also love to meet you in-person! :D

### Let’s Take a Tour

Now that you’re all set up, let’s see what you can do with this new awesome tool. Even though this is the first version of ConConnecter there is quite a lot of interesting features.

**Search:** Look for specific companies, people, keywords, topic, etc. Once you find what you are looking for, you can visualize and explore the subgraph in more details.

**Tweets:** Under the search option, you can easily track new incoming tweets related to the conference and see what people are talking about. Clicking on a specific tweet lets you see what it’s connected to, which can give you great insights into what’s being discussed around every topic and by whom.

**Filtering:** Under the Legend, you can unselect the elements that you don’t want to see on the graph. This let’s you declutter the visualisation and make exploring the Conference Graph a littler smoother.

### What Are You Waiting For?!

There you have it, a new cool tool that will hopefully make your experience at Strata Data a little more fun! We can’t wait to hear about your experience with ConConnector.
