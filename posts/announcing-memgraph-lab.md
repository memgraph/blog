# Announcing Memgraph Lab

I’m excited to introduce Memgraph Lab, an openCypher and Bolt compatible integrated development environment used to import data, develop, debug, profile database queries and visualize the query results.

In this Beta release, the focus was on building the basic querying and visualization capabilities with support for OSX and Debian based operating systems only for now.

In future releases, we’ll add support for debugging and profiling queries, importing data using Graph Streams, and ultimately deliver a whole set of features for graph experts and analysts alike.

I invite you to download Memgraph Lab [here](https://memgraph.com/download/memgraph-lab) and try it out. Any feedback you are able to share is really appreciated!

Before trying out Memgraph Lab, you should download, install and spin up a Memgraph instance. You can download Docker image, deb or rpm package of Memgraph [here](https://memgraph.com/download/).
