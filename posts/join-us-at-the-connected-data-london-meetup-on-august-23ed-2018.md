# Join us at The Connected Data London Meetup on August 23rd 2018

#### We’ll be introducing you to the next generation of graph databases and we couldn’t be more excited!

## Why Should I Attend?

Graph databases have demonstrated the ability for organizations, from cutting-edge startups to global enterprises, to extract data intelligence that was next to impossible with traditional DBMS.

However, first-generation graph databases fall short when it comes to delivering the real-time performance and scalability required to build modern applications.

Memgraph is on a mission to fulfil the true potential of graph databases and open the doors to a whole new era of applications, by bringing to life a high-performance, horizontally scalable graph platform.

On this evening, Dominik Tomicevic, our CEO, will take you through our journey building the world’s fastest and most scalable graph platform, describe new and exciting use-cases we’re working on, and conclude by giving you an insight into the future of real-time graph databases and the role they will play in powering the next generation of business applications.

## What is it?

The Connected Data London meetup is for people interested in Connected Data technologies and developments. This includes Graph Database, Linked Data, semantics, Knowledge Representation and AI experts, users, enthusiasts and newbies.
